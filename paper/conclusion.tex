\chapter{Conclusion}

We demonstrate that MPK can be used to provide lightweight, low-overhead, and robust sandboxing of
memory-unsafe code within a Rust program. Our technique both prevents undefined behavior in
memory-unsafe code from corrupting memory used by safe portions of the program, and additionally
prevents invalid values (such as corrupt pointers) returned from memory-unsafe code from inducing
undefined behavior within memory-safe portions of the program. We implemented a modified version of
\cc{bindgen} to automatically generate thunk functions to securely and type-safely call and return
from sandboxed functions, with a performance overhead of approximately 25ns per function call
on our test system.
