\abstract{
    As the software engineering industry adopts memory-safe programming languages for security- and
    performance-sensitive systems programming, developers face a need for interoperability between
    memory-safe and memory-unsafe codebases, without compromising on either security or performance.
    We present a technique for sandboxing unsafe dependencies within a safe program, using hardware
    features such as Intel's Memory Protection Keys to prevent memory corruption bugs within unsafe
    code from affecting the safe portions of the program. We use the type system and metaprogramming
    capabilities of the Rust programming language to create a low-overhead, ergonomic, and type- and
    memory-safe interface allowing the safe portions of the program to freely interact with the
    unsafe portions, without risk of inducing undefined behavior in memory-safe code.
